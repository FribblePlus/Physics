            <h1>Energy Conservation</h1>
            <p>When we draw a Sankey diagram, we can assume that the total thickness
                of the arrow remains constant. We could not have an
                arrow which got thinner (energy disappearing) or thicker
                (energy appearing out of nowhere).
                We are assuming that energy is conserved. This is
                a principle, known as the principle of conservation of
                energy, which we expect to apply in all situations.</p>
                <p class="highlight">Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be
                    converted from one form to another.</p>
                <p>Although we cannot prove that energy is always
                    conserved, this example shows that the principle of
                    conservation of energy can be a powerful tool in helping us
                    to understand what is going on in nature, and that it can help
                    us to make fruitful predictions about future experiments</p>
