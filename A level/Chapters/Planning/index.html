            <h2>Defining the problem</h2>
            <p>Here you are required to identify the variables in the experiment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Independent variable</span> it is a variable whose variation does not depend on that of another.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Dependent variable</span> it is a variable whose value depends on that of another.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In simpler terms, the independent variable is the variable you are going to vary in the experiment, and the dependent variable is the variable you are going to measure in the experiment (pay attention to the words ‘vary’ and ‘measure’).

                After the identification of variables, you are required to identify the quantities you are going to keep constant. Any quantity which may vary your results, other than quantities involved in the experiment, must be kept constant. Mention ‘how’ you are going to make sure it does not change, and ‘why’ you think it should be kept constant. While you do this, keep in mind one thing that there may be a lot of such quantities that need to be kept constant; always mention that quantity which DIRECTLY affects the variables being measured.</p>
            
            <h2>Methods of data collection</h2>
            <p>Now that you have mentioned the variables, you need to describe how to measure them. Describe the method to vary the independent variable, and a method to measure the effect on the dependent variable. State all instruments used.
                <br><br>
                In the example question, two variables are involved in the experiment, λ (independent) and h (dependent). λ can be varied by using different colored LEDs/lasers (red, green, blue, etc) and using the values for λ given on these LEDs/lasers for any calculations/analysis. The corresponding values of ‘h’ can be measured using a meter rule/plastic ruler.
                <br><br>
                As you can see now, I described above ‘HOW’ I am going to vary the independent variable, and ‘HOW’ I am going to measure the dependent variable. I also stated all the instruments used too. Along with all this, you are also required to mention the SETUP (discussed below) for the experiment; for instance, how you are going to place the LEDs/lasers (any appropriate method to support the light source, like clamping the light source using a retort stand, etc.), how you are going to place the ruler (placing the ruler close to the maxima on the screen).
                <br><br>
                You also need to describe how any errors possible may be prevented; these points you mention are counted as additional details.
                <br><br>
                Also include details on how you are going to keep constant quantities you mentioned before constant (In the example experiment described above, the constant quantity was the angle of the incident light. It can be kept constant by holding the light source using a retort stand, and not changing its position the entire experiment)
                <br><br>
                In some cases, there are no proper instruments available for the measurement of dependent quantity. For example, resistance cannot be measured using a conventional piece of apparatus directly. So for that purpose, mention all the measurements you need to take for its calculation and the instruments used (ammeter used for measurement of current, voltmeter used for measurement of p.d. across the resistor. R is then calculated using the equation: R = V/I).</p>

            <h2>Method of analysis</h2>

            <p>In all papers, an equation is given which you need to test or experiment about. Algebraically manipulate the given equation to form a linear relationship (Y = mX + c) – choose what quantity should be on each axis to give a straight line graph.</p>
            <img src="/AS level/Chapters/Planning/images/image1.png" alt="">
            <p>Once you are done algebraically manipulation the equation into a linear form, describe what the graph will look like if the given relationship is true, e.g.</p>
            <img src="/AS level/Chapters/Planning/images/image2.png" alt="">
            <p>Also mention, where the line will intersect the y-axix, and what will the gradient of the plotted relationship.
<br>
                If quantities are asked to calculated, as in the example question given above, that can be done as follows:
              <br>  
                The equation given in the example question is:</p>
            <img src="/AS level/Chapters/Planning/images/Screenshot 2023-06-22 181423.png" alt="">
            <p>Converting this linear form; (y = mx + c) form, we get:
                <br>
                (the given equation is already in the linear form, so I’m just making it look like one by the use of brackets)</p>
                <img src="/AS level/Chapters/Planning/images/image4.png" alt="">
                <p>h is plotted on the y-axis against λ on the x-axis.
<br><br>
                    By comparing it with linear form, we know that, n/d = m = gradient, and B = c = y-intercept.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore,</p>
                    <img src="/AS level/Chapters/Planning/images/image5.png" alt="">
                    <p>and</p>
                    <img src="/AS level/Chapters/Planning/images/image6.png" alt="">
                <p>These all steps of conversion to linear form, graphical form, gradient, y-intercept, and calculation of quantities come under ‘Analysis of Data’.</p>
            <h2>Additional detail including safety considerations</h2>
            <p>Any hazards/harms involved while performing the experiment go here; for every hazard/harm, mention a way to avoid it.
                <br><br>
                For the example question, the safety precautions needed are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Looking directly at the bright light source may damage your eyes [safety precaution: wear goggles, do not look directly, safety screens, etc.]
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other common safety issues for other experiments may be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In electricity experiments, electrocution may occur [safety precaution: wear gloves
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If heating is involved, burns may occur; fire [safety precaution: wear gloves, use holders for picking up hot objects; turn off heating instruments between taking measurements]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For experiments involving heavy objects, moving objects, they may fall on your foot if slipped from bench/table, sand bucket for falling masses or moving objects may hit you, resulting in eye injuries or other face injuries [make sure heavy objects not placed near edges, supports are strong, wear goggles to prevent moving objects hitting your eyes]
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>There may be many more such harms possible, and many more precautions necessary depending on the experiment.
